# ReactiveLamp

## Inspiration
Over this semester, I had been continually interested in the space of self-actuating materials and light sculptures. I had been quite inspired by work in human computer interaction involving conductive textiles as a mechanism for movement. Because I didn’t have the expertise of creating self-actuating textiles, I wanted to explore how I could create a structure that would allow me to use motors to embed movement. 

Concurrently, I was curious to explore what type of role embedded systems could play in our lived environment. I would often work in the SOM and see the roller shades slowly slide down the window when the sun was setting so as to keep the sun from directly hitting the building. I was interested in exploring if that same sort of reactivity could be embedded into decorative furniture like lamps.   

## Design

### 1: Building the structure

The concentric circles that make up the frame of the lamp is the most essential element that allows for sufficent range of movement. To build these circles, I lasercut a 24x24 inch (1/8 inch think) plank of plywood into concentric circles of 1/8 inch width. The radius of the circles ranged from 3 inches to 18 inches.
